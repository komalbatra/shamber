**Shamber**

The Shamber is a website that servers two primary purposes:

1.  Share-a-Shame – Gives users an opportunity to share a shame with the
    community. This message posts to the new area of our Wall-of-Shame 
    and includes the user’s name, their shame, and date posted.

2.  Wall-of-Shame –A message scrawl that included messages sorted by 
    newest, and a scrawl that includes messages sorted by top votes.     

Users can look at others’ shames and vote on their favorites, voting them up or down in rank.
The app will put messages with the most votes at the top of the     listing, including the top 20 in the database.
